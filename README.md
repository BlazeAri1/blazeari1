## Hello!

If you're reading this - please go to my Codeberg account. I won't be posting any more of my projects here.
Why?
- GitHub isn't open source
- The code on GitHub is used to train the AI
- Microsoft is blocking access for different countries. Why use GitHub via VPN when there is a better alternative - Codeberg?
